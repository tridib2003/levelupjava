    <div class="description-std">
        Packages are containers for classes. We can define classes inside a package that are not accessible by code outside the package. Also, we can define class members that are visible to other members present in the same package. We can create a class having a certain name within a package without having the concern that it may collide with some other class, stored in another package. Hence packages help us to keep the class namespace compartmentalized as well as packages act a visibility control mechanism.

        <br>
        A package can be created by including the <strong>package</strong> command as  the first statement in our java source code file. The package statement defines the namespace in which the classes are stored. If we don't write the package statement, the classes stored in the default package, which has no name.
