    <div class="description-std">
        Packages are containers for classes. We can define classes inside a package that are not accessible by code
        outside the package. Also, we can define class members that are visible to other members present in the same
        package. We can create a class having a certain name within a package without having the concern that it may
        collide with some other class, stored in another package. Hence packages help us to keep the class namespace
        compartmentalized as well as packages act a visibility control mechanism.
        <br>
        <br>
        A package can be created by including the <strong>package</strong> command as the first statement in our java
        source code file. The package statement defines the namespace in which the classes are stored. If we don't write
        the package statement, the classes are stored in the default package, which has no name.
